This assignment was my final project for CMPINF 2100 - Introduction to Data Centric Computing in my Masters of Data Science program at the University of Pittsburgh

Using real data from the Pitt Athletics Department, I built a data model that predicted with the following results:

Accuracy: 79.4%
Precision: 81.0%
Recall: 90.0%
F1 Score: 85.2%
Specificity: 58.3%
False Positive Rate: 41.7%
False Negative Rate: 10.0%
